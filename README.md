# Front-end Choose Your Own Adventure Take-Home

Design and build a comments feed that displays all comments and notifies a user in real-time when new comments are added.

Here is the data schema for a Comment:
* id: INTEGER
* name: TEXT
* created: DATETIME
* message: TEXT

Here are the API endpoints:
* Create a comment: /createComment (POST)
* Retrieve all comments: /getComments (GET)
* Retrieve a comment: /getComment (GET)
* Delete all comments: /deleteComments (DELETE)
  * This is useful for purging data

This is a basic wireframe, you can change the layout. While you won't be screened as a product designer, make sure you build a good user experience. If you decide to use a third-party design system, be prepared to discuss your decision.

Please write unit tests and handle errors where you see fit.

## Engineering Style

We do not expect you to have expertise in all the topics that encapsulate front-end web development. We recognize that some folks are specialists and others are generalists!

### Specialist

If there's a particular topic you enjoy, you can focus your assignment solution on that!

Some examples include:
* Performance optimizations
* Accessibility
* Integration testing

### Generalist

If you're a generalist, you can focus more on building the minimum viable product described above with the wireframe!

## Interview Details

We have already set up an API client for a Node Express server that stores comments in SQLite.

You have the option of doing the assignment with or without a front-end JS framework.

If you decide to use a framework, we recommend the following boilerplates:
* [facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [vuejs/vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
* [angular/angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
* [ember-cli/ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli)

Be prepared to have a discussion about your implementation. Here are some example discussion questions:
* How can you optimize fetching new comments in real-time?
* Are there any restrictions we should place on the comment input?

We recommend spending up to four hours on this assignment. If you don't get every piece you hoped completed done in the timeframe, that's alright! We'll be having an hour long discussion on your thought processes and where you might spend more time, and that discussion is a key part of our evaluation!

## Quickstart

Click this button to create a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) workspace with the project set up and Fly pre-installed

[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack/tree/main)

## Development

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

### Relevant code:

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly

  ```sh
  fly auth signup
  ```

  > **Note:** If you have more than one Fly account, ensure that you are signed into the same account in the Fly CLI as you are in the browser. In your terminal, run `fly auth whoami` and ensure the email matches the Fly account signed into the browser.

- Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

  ```sh
  fly apps create mailchimp-front-end-challenge-021e
  fly apps create mailchimp-front-end-challenge-021e-staging
  ```

  > **Note:** Make sure this name matches the `app` set in your `fly.toml` file. Otherwise, you will not be able to deploy.

  - Initialize Git.

  ```sh
  git init
  ```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new), and then add it as the remote for your project. **Do not push your app yet!**

  ```sh
  git remote add origin <ORIGIN_URL>
  ```

- Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

- Add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app mailchimp-front-end-challenge-021e
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app mailchimp-front-end-challenge-021e-staging
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1Password](https://1password.com/password-generator) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Create a persistent volume for the sqlite database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app mailchimp-front-end-challenge-021e
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app mailchimp-front-end-challenge-021e-staging
  ```

Now that everything is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

### Connecting to your database

The sqlite database lives at `/data/sqlite.db` in your deployed application. You can connect to the live database by running `fly ssh console -C database-cli`.

### Getting Help with Deployment

If you run into any issues deploying to Fly, make sure you've followed all of the steps above and if you have, then post as many details about your deployment (including your app name) to [the Fly support community](https://community.fly.io). They're normally pretty responsive over there and hopefully can help resolve any of your deployment issues and questions.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
